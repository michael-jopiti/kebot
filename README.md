Kebot, born 31.03.2024, starts as a Telegram bot able to take commands to operate with the spotify API in order to take suggestions by text message and create a playlist satisfying all members of the Apero at Maikel's place.

Many ideas come to mind and could maybe find life in the future, here some of them:
    - display all photos sent to the bot on a screen (maybe also add those tagged on various socials), at the end of the night, create a cloud directory to store the photo and share them with those who were present

    - import a text-to-text AI interpreter to make the conversation with the bot more realistic, keeping the geeky part that "normal" people hate aside


Best,

Michael :D
