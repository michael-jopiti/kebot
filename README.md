Link to bot: t.me/itsKebot

Kebot, born 31.03.2024, starts as a Telegram bot able to take commands to operate with the spotify API in order to take suggestions by text message and create a playlist satisfying all members of the Apero at Maikel's place.

If you want to recreate it for your own project, remember to create a config.txt in telegram/ with the bot-token in the first line, and @itsName in the second one :)

Many ideas come to mind and could maybe find life in the future, here some of them:

- store photos sent on a cloud in order to store them and send the link to everybody by the end of the party
- display statistics of the music (maybe also custom messages) on a screen
- import a text-to-text AI interpreter to make the conversation with the bot more realistic, keeping the geeky part that "normal" people hate aside


Best,

Michael :D
